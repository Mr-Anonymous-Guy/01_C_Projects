## 🚀 Overview

This repository is part of my **multi-language GitHub portfolio**, where I build and showcase projects in C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript — from basic logic programs to AI-integrated systems.

These C programs are designed to:
- Strengthen logic building and algorithmic thinking  
- Explore file handling, data structures, and memory management  
- Serve as practice material for students and interview preparation
